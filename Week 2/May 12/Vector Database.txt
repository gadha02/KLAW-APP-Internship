Vector Database 

A vector database indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search, with capabilities like CRUD operations, metadata filtering, horizontal scaling, and serverless. 

Efficient data processing has become more crucial than ever for applications that involve LLMs, generative AI, and semantic search.All of these new applications rely on vector embedding, a type of vector data representation that carries within it semantic information that’s critical for the AI to gain understanding and maintain a long-term memory they can draw upon when executing complex tasks. 

Embeddings are generated by AI models (such as LLMs) and have many attributes or features, making their representation challenging to manage. In the context of AI and machine learning, these features represent different dimensions of the data that are essential for understanding patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.That is why we need a specialized database designed specifically for handling this data type. 

The challenge of working with vector data is that traditional scalar-based databases can’t keep up with the complexity and scale of such data, making it difficult to extract insights and perform real-time analysis. That’s where vector databases come into play – they are intentionally designed to handle this type of data and offer the performance, scalability, and flexibility you need to make the most out of your data. 


How does a vector database work? 

We all know how traditional databases work by store strings, numbers, and other types of scalar data in rows and columns. On the other hand, a vector database operates on vectors, so the way 
it’s optimized and queried is quite different. In traditional databases, we are usually querying for rows in the database where the value usually exactly matches our query. In vector databases, we apply a similarity metric to find a vector that is the most similar to our query. 

• A vector database uses a combination of different algorithms that all participate in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.  
• These algorithms optimize the search through hashing, quantization, or graph-based search. 
• These algorithms are assembled into a pipeline that provides fast and accurate retrieval of the neighbors of a queried vector. 
• Since the vector database provides approximate results, the main trade-offs we consider are between accuracy and speed.  

The more accurate the result, the slower the query will be. However, a good system can provide ultra-fast search with near-perfect accuracy.
