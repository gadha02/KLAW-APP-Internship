What is a single-agent RAG?
Single-Agent RAG is a setup where one language model handles both retrieving relevant documents and generating responses. It queries a knowledge source, gathers context, and produces an answer—all within a single workflow. This approach is simple, easy to manage, and effective for moderately complex tasks that don't require specialized roles.



What is a multi-agent RAG?
Multi-Agent RAG takes a collaborative approach where multiple specialized agents work together to complete the retrieval and generation process. Each agent focuses on a distinct task—such as retrieving documents, summarizing content, or reasoning over information. By distributing the workload, this setup allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and the incorporation of domain-specific expertise. It is especially useful for handling complex or layered tasks that benefit from a modular and coordinated workflow.


Multi-agent systems vs. single agents
The core difference between single-agent and multi-agent RAG architectures lies in how responsibilities are handled and how the system scales with task complexity.

In a single-agent RAG setup, one model is responsible for both retrieving relevant information and generating the final response. This means the model must be capable of understanding the query, fetching appropriate documents (often through an embedded retriever or via an API call to a vector store), interpreting the retrieved content, and synthesizing a coherent output. Since all actions are performed within a single loop, it offers low latency and minimal orchestration overhead. However, this also creates limitations: the agent can be a generalist at best. It lacks specialization and may underperform on queries that require deep understanding, multi-step reasoning, or domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, maintaining accuracy and context coherence in more complex tasks becomes challenging because the single agent needs to manage everything within a limited context window.

In contrast, multi-agent RAG systems adopt a collaborative architecture in which multiple agents are designed with distinct roles and can communicate with each other. For example, one agent may be tasked with only document retrieval (optimized with fast access to a dense vector database), another may perform summarization or filtering of those documents, while a third could generate the final answer. Each agent may even use different underlying LLMs suited to its function—lightweight models for retrieval, larger models for reasoning, etc. This approach enables task specialization, parallel execution, and greater modularity. The agents can engage in iterative dialogue, verify each other’s outputs, and collectively build a more refined and accurate response. However, this increased capability comes at the cost of added system complexity, coordination mechanisms, and potential latency.
