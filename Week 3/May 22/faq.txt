What is ChromaDB?
ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database for LLM applications.

What is Gemini?
Gemini is Google's multimodal large language model that can process text, code, and images.

What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It enhances LLMs by injecting relevant retrieved documents into the generation process.

What is a vector database?
A vector database stores and retrieves high-dimensional embeddings to support similarity-based queries.

Why use RAG over plain LLM?
RAG helps LLMs answer questions more accurately by providing relevant facts from a document store.

Can Gemini be used with RAG?
Yes, Gemini can be combined with RAG by retrieving context and using Gemini to generate answers.

Is ChromaDB persistent?
Yes, ChromaDB can persist data locally using `PersistentClient`.

What is a collection in ChromaDB?
A collection is a logical grouping of documents, similar to a table in a database.

How many documents can ChromaDB store?
ChromaDB can scale to millions of documents depending on hardware and indexing strategy.

Can RAG handle real-time questions?
Yes, RAG systems can handle real-time queries by fetching and injecting context before LLM generation.

What is an FAQ chatbot?
An FAQ chatbot answers frequently asked questions using preloaded content and LLMs.

What happens if no matching documents are found?
The chatbot will typically inform the user that no relevant information is available.

What is the purpose of a RAG retriever?
The retriever finds relevant documents from a database to provide context for the LLM.
