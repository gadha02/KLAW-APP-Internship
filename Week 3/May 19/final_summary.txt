Artificial intelligence (AI) enables computer systems to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making.  AI applications range from search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and generative tools.  The field's goals include achieving general intelligence—matching or exceeding human capabilities—through techniques like machine learning (including deep learning), logic, and optimization.  AI research faces challenges like knowledge representation (especially commonsense knowledge) and efficient reasoning.  The field has experienced periods of boom and "AI winters" (funding decreases), with recent advancements in deep learning and generative AI fueling rapid growth and prompting discussions about ethical implications and regulation.
